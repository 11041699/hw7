                    <h3>Superhot Hot Sauce Recipe</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong> Roast the Peppers. </strong>Heat an oven to 400 degrees. Set the superhot chili peppers and garlic on a baking sheet and bake them about 15-20 minutes, or until the skins slightly char. Keep an eye on these. You don't want them to burn, and watch out for any fumes.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Process the Ingredients.</strong> Add peppers to a food processor. Squeeze garlic out of their skins and into the food processor they go. Add basil leaves and process.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Vinegar.</strong> While processing, add in vinegar until it is nicely pureed. Watch out for the fumes!
                        <br>
                        <strong>Salt and Strain, if Desired. </strong> Add salt and stir. Push the sauce through a strainer or use a food mill to really strain it, if desired. Adjust with more vinegar or water to your desired consistency.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Bottle It Up. Pour into bottles and enjoy.</strong> Give to your friends! The longer you let it sit, the more the flavors will meld.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Boom! Done!</strong> There it is, my friends! Crazy hot hot sauce! Did the fumes get you? How are you going to use this sauce? I'd love to hear it! Talk about heat!

                    <h3>Italian Giardiniera</h3>
                    <p>
                    <strong> Brine the Vegetables. </strong>To a large bowl, add all of the peppers, carrot, celery and cauliflower. Sprinkle with salt. Cover with cold water and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, covered. I like to brine mine for 24 hours or longer for maximum flavor.  Drain and rinse away the brine. Set aside.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Make the Vinaigrette.</strong> In a separate bowl, add garlic, basil, celery seed and ground pepper to taste. Add vinegar and oil and whisk to combine.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Store in Jars.</strong>  Pack the vegetables into jars, ensuring the vegetables are covered with your vinegar/oil mixture. I like to use smaller jars.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Refrigerate. </strong>  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 days before using, to allow flavors to mingle. A week is better! This will last for several weeks or longer.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Boom! Done!</strong> Italian style giardiniera in the house! Ready to serve! I love this stuff. Pretty easy to make, isn't it?

                    <h3>Homemade Tabasco Sauce</h3>
                    <p>
                    <strong> Add the tabasco peppers, </strong> vinegar and Â¼ teaspoon salt to a small pot.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Bring the mixture to a quick boil,</strong> then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes to soften.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Cool slightly,</strong>  then add to a food processor. Process until smooth. Gorgeous red pepper sauce right there already, much like the Tabasco original red sauce, but brighter in color.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Strain the pepper seeds and pulp mixture  </strong> to remove the solids. Look at how much of the seeds and pulp remains. You don't need to seed the peppers first, as we're straining the hot sauce.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Pour into hot sauce bottles and enjoy. </strong> You can adjust the volume with additional water and/or vinegar.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Boom! That's it, my friends. </strong> Now you have your very own homemade tabasco sauce, ready to drizzle and splash over all of your favorite foods. Add a bit of spice to your lives! I hope you enjoy it.
